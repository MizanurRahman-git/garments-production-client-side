Users who want to sell clothing products can apply for a Manager role. After approval from the Admin, Managers can list their own products on FEBRIC FASION. They have full control over their products, including adding new items, editing product details, managing inventory, and handling orders. Managers can view customer orders, approve or accept orders, and manage sales related to their products.

The platform is fully controlled by an Admin, who has complete authority over the system. The Admin manages all users and assigns roles, deciding who becomes a Manager and who remains a Customer. The Admin also oversees products, orders, and overall website operations to ensure a smooth and secure shopping experience.

FEBRIC FASION is designed with a role-based system that creates a reliable, well-organized, and scalable fashion marketplace for customers, sellers, and administrators.
